7. You have declared a variable named db_connection_string inside of the app module. However, when you run a terraform apply, you get the following error message:
````tf
Error: Reference to undeclared input variable
 
on main.tf line 35:
4: db_path = var.db_connection_string
 
An input variable with the name "db_connection_string" has not been declared. This variable can be declared with a variable "db_connection_string" {} block.
````

Why would you receive such an error?

a. an output block was not created in the module, & therefore the variable can't be referenced

b. the variable should be referenced as var.module.app.db_connection_string

c. since the variable was declared within the module, it can't be referenced outside of the module

d. input variables are not referenced using the var prefix

<details>
<summary>Answer 7. :</summary>
  c: since the variable was declared within the module, it can't be rferenced outside of the module<br/><br/>
  When using modules, it's common practice to declare variables outside of the module and pass the value(s) to the child module when it is called by the parent/root module. However, it's perfectly acceptable to declare a variable inside of a module if you needed. Any variables declared inside of a module are only directly referencable within that module. You can't directly reference that variable outside of the module. You can, however, create an output in the module to export any values that might be needed outside of the module.<br/>
