18. True or False? State is a requirement for Terraform to function.

a. False
  
b. True
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 18. :</summary>
  True<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  Terraform requires some sort of database to map Terraform config to the real world. When you have a resource in your configuration, Terraform uses this map to know how that resource is represented. Therefore, to map configuration to resources in the real world, Terraform uses its own state structure<br/>

19. When configuring a remote backend in Terraform, it might be a good idea to purposely omit some of the required arguments to ensure secrets and other relevant data are not inadvertently shared with others. What are the ways the remaining configuration can be added to Terraform so it can initialize and communicate with the backend? (select three)
  
a. directly querying HashiCorp Vault for the secrets
  
b. interactevely on the command line
  
c. command-line key/value pairs
  
d. use the -backend-config=PATH to specify a separate config file
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 19. :</summary>
  b: interactively on the command line<br/>
  c: command-line key/value pairs<br/>
  d: use the -backend-config=PATH to specify a separete config file<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  You do not need to specify every required argument in the backend configuration. Omitting certain arguments may be desirable to avoid storing secrets, such as access keys, within the main configuration. When some or all of the arguments are omitted, we call this a partial configuration.<br/>
  With a partial configuration, the remaining configuration arguments must be provided as part of the initialization process. There are several ways to supply the remaining arguments:<br/>
  Interactively: Terraform will interactively ask you for the required values unless interactive input is disabled. Terraform will not prompt for optional values.<br/>
  File: A configuration file may be specified via the init command line. To specify a file, use the -backend-config=PATH option when running terraform init. If the file contains secrets it may be kept in a secure data store, such as Vault, in which case it must be downloaded to the local disk before running Terraform.<br/>
  Command-line key/value pairs: Key/value pairs can be specified via the init command line. Note that many shells retain command-line flags in a history file, so this isn't recommended for secrets. To specify a single key/value pair, use the -backend-config="KEY=VALUE" option when running terraform init.

20. Your organization has moved to AWS and has manually deployed infrastructure using the console. Recently, a decision has been made to standardize on Terraform for all deployments moving forward.

What can you do to ensure that the existing resources are managed by Terraform moving forward without causing interruption to existing resources?
  
a. resources that are manually deployed in the AWS console can't be imported by Terraform
  
b. using `terraform import`, import the existing infrastructure into your Terraform state
  
c. delete the existing resources & recreate them using new a Terraform configuration so Terraform can manage them moving forward
  
d. submit a ticket to AWS & ask them to export the state of all existing resources & use `terraform import` to import them into the state file

43. Kristen is using modules to provision an Azure environment for a new application. She is using the following code and specifying a version of her virtual machine module to ensure she's calling the correct module. Which of the following provides support for the versioning of a module? (select two)
  
````tf
module "compute" {
  source  = "Azure/compute/azurerm"
  version = "3.8.0"
}
````
  
a. modules stored in GitLab
  
b. public module registry
  
c. private module registry
  
d. local file paths
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 43. :</summary>
  b: public module registry<br/>
  c: private module registry<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  Version constraints are supported only for modules installed from a module registry, such as the public Terraform Registry or Terraform Cloud's private module registry. Other module sources can provide their own versioning mechanisms within the source string itself, or might not support versions at all. In particular, modules sourced from local file paths do not support version; since they're loaded from the same source repository, they always share the same version as their caller.

45. In the terraform block, which configuration would be used to identify the specific version of a provider required?
  
a. required_providers
  
b. required-version
  
c. required_versions
  
d. required-providers
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 45. :</summary>
  a: required_providers<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  For production use, you should constrain the acceptable provider versions via configuration file to ensure that new versions with breaking changes will not be automatically installed by terraform init in the future. When terraform init is run without provider version constraints, it prints a suggested version constraint string for each provider<br/>
  terraform { <br/> &ensp; required_providers { <br/> &ensp; &ensp; aws = ">=3.1.0" <br/> &ensp; } <br/> }

48. What is the downside to using Terraform to interact with sensitive data, such as reading secrets from Vault?
  
a. Terraform & Vault must be running on the same version
  
b. Terraform requires a unique auth mehtods to work with Vault
  
c. secrets are persisted to the state file
  
d. Terraform & Vault must be running on the same physical host
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 48. :</summary>
  c: secrets are persisted to the state file<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  Interacting with Vault from Terraform causes any secrets that you read and write to be persisted in both Terraform's state file and in any generated plan files. For any Terraform module that reads or writes Vault secrets, these files should be treated as sensitive and protected accordingly.<br/>

50. What is the purpose of using the local-exec provisioner? (select two)
  
a. to invoke a local executable
  
b. executes a command on the resource to invoke an update to the Terraform state
  
c. ensures that the resource is only executed in the local infrastructure where Terraform is deployed
  
d. to execute one or more commands on the machine running Terraform
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 50. :</summary>
  a: to invoke a local executable<br/>
  d: to execute one or more commands on the machine running Terraform<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  The local-exec provisioner invokes a local executable after a resource is created. This invokes a process on the machine running Terraform, not on the resource<br/>
  Note that even though the resource will be fully created when the provisioner is run, there is no guarantee that it will be in an operable state - for example, system services such as sshd may not be started yet on compute resources<br/>

51. What is the best and easiest way for Terraform to read and write secrets from HashiCorp Vault?
  
a. CLI access from the same machine running Terraform
  
b. integration with a tool like Jenkins
  
c. Vault provider
  
d. API access using the AppRole auth method
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 51. :</summary>
  c: Vault provider<br/><br/>

52. Published modules via the Terraform Registry provide which of the following benefits? (select four)
  
a. show examples & READMEs
  
b. support from any code repo
  
c. automatically generated documentation
  
d. support versioning
  
e. allow browsing version histories

  a: show examples & READMEs<br/>
  c: automatically generated documentation<br/>
  d: support versioning<br/>
  e: allow browsing version histories<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  Public modules are managed via Git and GitHub. Publishing a module takes only a few minutes. Once a module is published, you can release a new version of a module by simply pushing a properly formed Git tag. The module must be on GitHub and must be a public repo. This is only a requirement for the public registry. If you're using a private registry, you may ignore this requirement.<br/>
  The key here is that HashiCorp uses GitHub for published modules.

54. Why is it a good idea to declare the required version of a provider in a Terraform configuration file?
````tf
terraform {
  required_providers {
    aws = "~> 1.0"
  }  
}
````
  
a. to ensure that the provider version matches the version of Terraform you are using
  
b. to match the version number of your application being deployed via Terraform
  
c. to remove older versions of the provider
  
d. providers are released on a separete schedule form Terraform itself; therfore a newer version could introduce breaking changes

55. Frank has a file named main.tf which is shown below. Which of the following statements are true about this code? (select two)
  
````tf
module "servers" {
  source = "./app-cluster"
 
  servers = 5
}
````
  
a. app-cluster is the calling module
  
b. main.tf is the child module
  
c. app-cluster is the child module
  
d. main.tf is the calling module
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 55. :</summary>
  c: app-cluster is the child module<br/>
  d: main.tf is the calling module<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  To call a module means to include the contents of that module into the configuration with specific values for its input variables. Modules are called from within other modules using module blocks. A module that includes a module block like this is the calling module of the child module<br/>
  The label immediately after the module keyword is a local name, which the calling module can use to refer to this instance of the module<br/>

56. In order to make a Terraform configuration file dynamic and/or reusable, static values should be converted to use what?
  
a. input variables
  
b. output value
  
c. regular expressions
  
d. module
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 56. :</summary>
  a: input variables<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  Input variables serve as parameters for a Terraform module, allowing aspects of the module to be customized without altering the module's own source code, and allowing modules to be shared between different configurations.<br/>

57. Terraform-specific settings and behaviors are declared in which configuration block type?
  
a. resource block
  
b. terraform block
  
c. provider block
  
d. data block
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 57. :</summary>
  b: terraform block<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  The special terraform configuration block type is used to configure some behaviors of Terraform itself, such as requiring a minimum Terraform version to apply your configuration<br/>
