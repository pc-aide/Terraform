5. Oscar is modifying his Terraform configuration file but isn't 100% sure it's correct. He is afraid that changes made could negatively affect production workloads. How can Oscar validate the changes that will be made without impacting existing workloads?

a. run a terraform validate to ensure the changes won't impact the production workloads

b. run terraform apply using a local-exec provisioner so the configuration won't impact existing workloads

c. run a terraform plan & validate the changes that will be made

d. run terraform refresh to compare his existing configuration file against the curre one

<details>
<summary>Answer 5. :</summary>
  c: run a terraform plan & validate the changes that will be made<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  he terraform plan command is used to create an execution plan. Terraform performs a refresh, unless explicitly disabled, and then determines what actions are necessary to achieve the desired state specified in the configuration files. This command is a convenient way to check whether the execution plan for a set of changes matches your expectations without making any changes to real resources or to the state.

8. True or False? The terraform apply -refresh-only command is used to reconcile the state Terraform knows about (via its state file) with the real-world infrastructure. If drift is detected between the real-world infrastructure and the last known-state, it will modify the infrastructure to correct the drift.

a. False

b. True

<details>
<summary>Answer 8. :</summary>
  false<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  The terraform apply -refresh-only command is used to reconcile the state Terraform knows about (via its state file) with the real-world infrastructure. This can be used to detect any drift from the last-known state, and to update the state file. Note that this used to be terraform refresh but that command was deprecated in Terraform v0.15.4<br/>
  This does not modify infrastructure but does modify the state file. If the state is changed, this may cause changes to occur during the next plan or apply.<br/>

9. When multiple arguments with single-line values appear on consecutive lines at the same nesting level, HashiCorp recommends that you:

a. place all arguments using a variable at the top
````tf
ami = var.aws_ami
instance_type = var.instance_size
subnet_id = "subnet-0bb1c79de3EXAMPLE"
tags = {
  Name = "HelloWorld

b. place a space in between each line
````tf
type = "A"

ttl = "300"

zone_ide = aws_route53_zone.primary.zone_id
````

c. align the equals signs
````tf
ami           = "abc123"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
````

d. put arguments in alphabetical order
````tf
name "www.example.com"
records = [aws_eip.lb.public_ip]

11. Harry has deployed resources on Azure for his organization using Terraform. However, he has discovered that his co-workers Ron and Ginny have manually created a few resources using the Azure console. Since it's company policy to manage production workloads using IaC, how can Harry start managing these resources in Terraform without negatively impacting the availability of the deployed resources?

a. resource created outside of Terraform can't be managed by Terraform

b. use terraform import to import the existing resource under Terraform management

c. run a terraform get to retrieve other resources that ar not under Terraform management

d. rewrite the Terraform configuration file to deploy new resources, run a terraform apply, & migrate users to the newly deployed resources. Manually delete to the other resources created by Ron & Ginny

<details>
<summary>Answer 11. :</summary>
  b: use terraform import to import the existing resources under Terraform management<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  The terraform import command is used to import existing resources into Terraform. This allows you to take resources that you’ve created by some other means and bring them under Terraform management.<br/>
  ote that terraform import DOES NOT generate configuration, it only modifies state. You'll still need to write a configuration block for the resource for which it will be mapped using the terraform import command.<br/>

12. When using providers that require the retrieval of data, such as the HashiCorp Vault provider, in what phase does Terraform actually retrieve the data required, assuming you are following the standard workflow of write, plan, and apply?

a. terraform init

b. terraform apply

c. terraform plan

d. terraform destroy

<details>
<summary>Answer 12. :</summary>
  c: terraform plan<br/<br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  It is important to consider that Terraform reads from data sources during the plan phase and writes the result into the plan. For something like a Vault token which has an explicit TTL, the apply must be run before the data, or token, in this case, expires, otherwise, Terraform will fail during the apply phase.<br/>
  Another example of this is AWS credentials:<br/>
  The token is generated from the moment the configuration retrieves the temporary AWS credentials (on terraform plan or terraform apply). If the apply run is confirmed after the 120 seconds, the run will fail because the credentials used to initialize the Terraform AWS provider has expired. For these instances or large multi-resource configurations, you may need to adjust the default_lease_ttl_seconds.<br/>

13. Freddy and his co-worker Jason are deploying resources in GCP using Terraform for their team. After resources have been deployed, they need to destroy the cloud-based resources to save on costs. However, two other team members, Michael and Chucky, are using a Cloud SQL instance for testing and are asking to keep it running.

How can Freddy and Jason easily destroy all other resources without negatively impacting the database?

a. take a snapshot of the db, run a terraform destroy, & then recreate the db in the GCP console by restoring the snapshot

b. run a terraform destroy, modify the configuration file to include only the Cloud SQL resource, & then run a terraform apply

c. delete the entire state file using the terraform state rm command & manually delete other resource in GCP

d. run a terraform state rm command to remove the Cloud SQL instance form Terraform managment before running the terraform destroy command

Where are these plugins downloaded and stored on the server?

a. The .terraform/providers directory in the current working directory

b. The .terraform.d directory in the current working directory

c. The .terraform.plugins directory in the current working directory

d. /etc/terraofmr/plugins

<details>
<summary>Answer 14. :</summary>
  a: the .terraform/providers directory in the current working directory<br/><br/>

16. Sara has her entire application automated using Terraform, but she now needs to start including more infrastructure pieces, such as creating a new subnet, DNS record, and load balancer. Like the Terraform pro she is, Sara requires that these new resources be created within modules so she can easily reuse the code later. However, Sara is having problems getting the subnet_id from the subnet module to pass to the load balancer module. What could fix this problem?

a. move the subnet & load balancer resource into the main configuration file so they can easily be referenced

b. publish the module to a Terraform registry first

c. references to resources in a module can't be used within other modules

d. add an output that references the subnet module & retrieve the value using module.subnet.subnet_id in the load baslancer module

17. Which of the following is an invalid variable name?

a. instance_name

b. web

c. count

d. var1

<details>
<summary>Answer 17. :</summary>
  c: count<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  count is a reserved word. The count parameter on resources can simplify configurations and let you scale resources by simply incrementing a number.

18. True or False? Rather than use state, Terraform can inspect cloud resources on every run.

a. False

b. True

<details>
<summary>Answer 18. :</summary>
  False<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  State is a necessary requirement for Terraform to function. And in the scenarios where Terraform may be able to get away without state, doing so would require shifting massive amounts of complexity from one place (state) to another place (the replacement concept).<br/>

  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.company_data]
}
````

a. The EIP with & id of ami-2757f631

b. The EC2 instance labeled web_server

c. The S3 bucket labeled company_data

d. The AMI used for the EC2 instance

<details>
<summary>Answer 20. :</summary>
  b: the EC2 instance labeled web_server<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  The EC2 instance labeled web_server is the implicit dependency as the aws_eip cannot be created until the aws_instance labeled web_server has been provisioned and the id is available.<br/>

30. Emma is a Terraform expert, and she has automated all the things with Terraform. During a recent deployment, a virtual machine was deployed but a local script did not work correctly, and therefore needs to be destroyed and recreated. How can Emma easily have Terraform recreate this one resource without having to destroy everything that was created?
  
a. use terraform import to import the error so Terraform is aware of the problem
  
b. use terraform refresh to refresh tthe state & make Terraform aware of the error
  
c. use terraform state rm aws_instance.web to remove the resource from the state file, which will cause Terraform to recreate the instance again
  
d. use terraform apply -replace=aws_instance.web to mark the VM for replacement

  The terraform apply -replace command manually marks a Terraform-managed resource for replacement, forcing it to be destroyed and recreated on the apply execution.<br/>
  You could also use terraform destroy -target <virtual machine> and destroy only the virtual machine and then run a terraform apply again.<br/>
  This command replaces terraform taint, which was the command that would be used up until 0.15.x. You may still see terraform taint on the actual exam until it is updated.<br/>

33. True or False? When using the Terraform provider for Vault, the tight integration between these HashiCorp tools provides the ability to mask secrets in the terraform plan and state files.
  
a. True
  
b. False
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 33. :</summary>
  False<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  Currently, Terraform has no mechanism to redact or protect secrets that are returned via data sources, so secrets read via this provider will be persisted into the Terraform state, into any plan files, and in some cases in the console output produced while planning and applying. These artifacts must, therefore, all be protected accordingly.<br/>

34. Henry has been working hard on automating his infrastructure for a new application using Terraform. His organization has standardized on Azure for application workloads. Currently, he has his application running successfully, but he has added a new resource to create a DNS record using the Infoblox provider. He has added the new resource but gets an error when he runs a terraform plan. What should Henry do first before running a plan and apply?
  
a. the Azure plugin doesn't support Infoblox directly, so Henry needs to put the DNS resource in another configuration file
  
b. Henry should run a terraform pla -refresh=true to update the state for the new DNS resource
  
c. you can't mix resource from different providers within the same configuration file, so Henry should create a module for the DNS resource & reference it form the main configuration
  
d. since he has introduced a new provider, a terraform init needs to be run to download the Infoblox plugin

  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  his variable declaration for a type list is incorrect because a list expects square brackets [ ] and not curly braces. All of the others are correct variable declarations. <br/>
  Lists/tuples are represented by a pair of square brackets containing a comma-separated sequence of values, like ["a", 15, true]

<details>
<summary>Answer 46. :</summary>
  a: terraform 0.12 introduced substantial changes to the syntax used to write Terraform configuration<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  You can use required_version to ensure that a user deploying infrastructure is using Terraform 0.12 or greater, due to the vast number of changes that were introduced. As a result, many previously written configurations had to be converted or rewritten.<br/>

50. A "backend" in Terraform determines how state is loaded and how an operation such as apply is executed. Which of the following is not a supported backend type?
  
a. artifactory
  
b. s3
  
c. github
  
d. terraform enterprise
  
e. consul
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 50. :</summary>
  c: github<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  GitHub is not a supported backend type. Check out the supported backends using the link below. Remember there is the "local" backend and then there are remote backends that store state elsewhere. Remote backends (and locking) are needed when more than one person is interacting with the same state file.<br/>

51. In Terraform, most resource dependencies are handled automatically. Which of the following statements describes best how Terraform resource dependencies are handled? 
  
a. Terraform analyzes an y expressions within a resource block to find references to other objects & treats those references as implicit ordering requirements when creating, updating, or destroying resources
  
b. Resource dependencies are heanled automatically by the depends_on meta_argument, which is set to true by default
  
c. The Terraform binary contains a bult-in reference map of all defined Terraform resource dependencies. Updates to this dependency map are reflected in Terraform versions. To ensure you are working with the latest resource dependency map you much be running the latest version of Terraform
  
d. Resource dependencies are identified & maintained in a file called resource.depndencies. Each terraform provider is required to maintain a list of all resource dependencies for the provider & it's included with the plugin during initialization when terraform init is executed. The file is located in the terraform.d folder

52. In the example below, the depends_on argument creates what type of dependency?
````tf
resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-2757f631"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  depends_on = [aws_s3_bucket.company_data]
}
````
  
a. implicit dependency
  
b. internal dependency
  
c. non-dependency resource
  
d. explicit dependency
  
<details>
<summary>Answer 52. :</summary>
  d: explicit dependency<br/><br/>
  <ins>Expl.</ins><br/>
  Sometimes there are dependencies between resources that are not visible to Terraform. The depends_on argument is accepted by any resource and accepts a list of resources to create explicit dependencies for.<br/>
