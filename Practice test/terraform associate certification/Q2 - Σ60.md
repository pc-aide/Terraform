20. Medium Corp iis making use of an open-source version of Terraform. You have created a number of reusable modules for various components that you want to share with your team.

What is the right approach to do that?

a. Terraform modules can't be shared in the OSS version. Each developer needs to maintain its own modules & leverage them in the main tf file

b. Store your modules in a NAS/ shared file server, & ask your team members to directly reference the code form there. This is the only viable option in terraform OSS, which is better than individually maintaining module versions for every developer

c. Terraform module sharing is only available in the Enterprise version via the terrform privte module registry, so no way to enable it in the OSS version

d. Upload your modules with proper versioning in the terraform module registry. Terraform OSS is directly integrated with the public module registry & can reference the module form the code in the main tf file
