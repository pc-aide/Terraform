52. Philip works at a payment processing company and manages the organization's VMware environment. He recently provisioned a new cluster for a production environment. To ensure everything is working as expected, Philip has been using Terraform and the VMware vSphere client to create and destroy new virtual machines. Currently, there are three virtual machines running on the new cluster, so Philip runs terraform destroy to remove the remaining virtual machines from the cluster. However, Terraform only removes two of the virtual machines, leaving one virtual machine still running.

Why would Terraform only remove two of the three virtual machines?

a. the remaining vm was not created by Terraform, therefore Terraform is not aware of the vm & can't destroy it

b. the vSphere provider credentials are invalid, & therefore Terraform can't reach the third vm

The next time that Jeff runs a terraform apply, the resource is not marked to be deleted. In fact, Terraform is stating that it is creating another identical resource.

````tf
.....
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.  
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 
Terraform will perform the following actions:
 
  # vsphere_virtual_machine.app1 will be created
````

What would explain this behavior?

a. Jeff removed the resource from the state file, & not the configuration file. Therefore, Terraform is no longer aware of the vm & assumes Jeff wants to create a new one since the vm is still in the Terraform configuration file

b.after running the terraform rm command, Jeff needs to run a Terraform plan first to tell Terraform of the updated configuration. A plan will instruct Terraform that the resource should be deleted upon the next terraform apply

c. the state file was not saved before the terraform apply was executed, therefore Terraform sees that the resource is still in the state file

d. the resource was manually deleted within the VMware infrastructure & needs to be recreated
