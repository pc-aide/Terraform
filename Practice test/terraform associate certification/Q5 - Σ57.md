d. all possible data of a specific Amazon Machine Image from AWS

<details>
<summary>Answer 23. :</summary>
  d: all possible data of a specific Amazon Machine Image form AWS<br/><br/>
  When you add a data block to your configuration, Terraform will retrieve all of the available data for that particular resource. It is then up to you to reference a specific attribute that can be exported from that data source. For example, if you include a data block for the aws_ami resource, Terraform will get a ton of attributes about that AMI that you can use elsewhere in your code - check out this link to see the list of attributes specific to the aws_ami, for example<br/>
  https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/data-sources/ami#attributes-reference<br/>
  Within the block body (between { and }) are query constraints defined by the data source. Most arguments in this section depend on the data source, and indeed in this example most_recent, owners and tags are all arguments defined specifically for the aws_ami data source.<br/>

````

a. data_processing

b. a random hex value

c. an empty string

d. IS Teams

<details>
<summary>Answer 43. :</summary>
  a: data_processing<br/><br/>
  The syntax of a conditional expression first names the condition. In this example, if var.name is not (!=) empty, assign the var.name value; else, assign the new random_id resource as the name value. Since var.name equals data_processing, then the value of Name will equal data_processing.

52. Philip works at a payment processing company and manages the organization's VMware environment. He recently provisioned a new cluster for a production environment. To ensure everything is working as expected, Philip has been using Terraform and the VMware vSphere client to create and destroy new virtual machines. Currently, there are three virtual machines running on the new cluster, so Philip runs terraform destroy to remove the remaining virtual machines from the cluster. However, Terraform only removes two of the virtual machines, leaving one virtual machine still running.

Why would Terraform only remove two of the three virtual machines?

a. the remaining vm was not created by Terraform, therefore Terraform is not aware of the vm & can't destroy it

b. the vSphere provider credentials are invalid, & therefore Terraform can't reach the third vm

c. Terraform can only destroy a maximum of 2 resources per terraform destroy execution

d. the vm was marked with vSphere tags to prevent it from being destroyed

<details>
<summary>Answer 52. :</summary>
  a: the remaining vm was not created by Terraform, therefore Terraform is not aware of the vm & can't destroy it

54. Jeff is a DevOps Engineer for a large company and is currently managing the infrastructure for many different applications using Terraform. Recently, Jeff received a request to remove a specific VMware virtual machine from Terraform as it is no longer needed by the application team. Jeff opens his terminal and issues the command:
````tf
$ terraform state rm vsphere_virtual_machine.app1
 
Removed vsphere_virtual_machine.app1
Successfully removed 1 resource instance(s).
````

The next time that Jeff runs a terraform apply, the resource is not marked to be deleted. In fact, Terraform is stating that it is creating another identical resource.

````tf
.....
An execution plan has been generated and is shown below.  
Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create
 
Terraform will perform the following actions:
 
  # vsphere_virtual_machine.app1 will be created
````

What would explain this behavior?

a. Jeff removed the resource from the state file, & not the configuration file. Therefore, Terraform is no longer aware of the vm & assumes Jeff wants to create a new one since the vm is still in the Terraform configuration file

b.after running the terraform rm command, Jeff needs to run a Terraform plan first to tell Terraform of the updated configuration. A plan will instruct Terraform that the resource should be deleted upon the next terraform apply

c. the state file was not saved before the terraform apply was executed, therefore Terraform sees that the resource is still in the state file

d. the resource was manually deleted within the VMware infrastructure & needs to be recreated

<details>
<summary>Answer 54. :</summary>
  a: Jeff removed the resource form the state file, & not the configuration file. Therefore, Terraform ...
