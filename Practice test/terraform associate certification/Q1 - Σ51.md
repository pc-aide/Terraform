a) True

b) False

<details>
<summary>Answer 33. :</summary>
  True<br/><br/>
  <ins>Exp.</ins><br/>
  Setting an output value in the root module as sensitive prevents Terraform from showing its value in the list of outputs at the end of terraform apply<br/>
  Sensitive output values are still recorded in the state, and so will be visible to anyone who is able to access the state data.
